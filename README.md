# Sentor_G | Rebrand Roadmap & 2026 Plan

## My name is Sentor/Sen and I am aspiring to become an independent and self-sufficient digital graphic designer.
I have been practicing digital graphic design and animation for over a decade and it is about time I put these skills to use. In 2018, I graduated from the University of Winchester with a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) degree in Digital Media Design. Since then, I have been taking on client projects to hone my craft and realise my place in the graphic design industry. All of these projects have been completed under no official name - and that is about to change. For that to happen, I need to move away from the Lotad focus which my online identity and livestream are built on. I wish to establish a new, marketable, fresh style and iconography. My artistic capabilities are about to start working for **me**.<br>
This GitHub page will serve as a roadmap of the rebrand and display what has been achieved so far/what is left to come.
